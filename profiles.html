    Description</h1>
<p>
The item I chose was two AA batteries that I threw out a week ago. They feel smooth and have a cylindrical shape, with a wrapper around them. There was battery acid on both the tops and bottoms. I got the batteries from home, and they were meant to go inside my Polaroid camera. I got the Polaroid from an old friend who gave it to me for my birthday a long time ago. After we had a falling out, I stopped using it, and I don’t really like using it now because it reminds me of them. Recently, another friend picked it up and tried to take a picture with it. When it didn’t work, they opened the battery compartment and told me I should change the batteries because they were so old that battery acid had leaked onto them. I threw the batteries out and replaced them, but the Polaroid still doesn’t work.
<p><br>
<h1>Anecdote</h1>
<p><br>
My friend and I were in my room taking a break from studying and they noticed my polaroid inside my wooden corner shelf. They picked it up and tried to take a picture of me as a joke but the flash didn't go off. He played around with the shutter and lens barrel and clicked it again but nothing happened. Then he slid open the battery compartment and noticed that the batteries were all gross and had battery acid on them and a bit inside. He said "ohh thats why, you need to change the batteries" and I took them out and threw them into my trash. Later when I went home during break, I took new AA batteries with me on my way back. I put them inside, aimed the polaroid at the window, and still nothing went off. I don't know what happened to the polaroid, but when I have time I'll try to fix it or research what happened.
